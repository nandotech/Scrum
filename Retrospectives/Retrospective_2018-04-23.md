# Sprint Retrospective 4/23/2018

#### Monday // Prior to planning next sprint

1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?

1. Organization and forcing myself to see the work to be done and what has been done very day was hugely motivating. Just writing down things that I expect to see done seems to make quite a big difference, plus setting actual goals as opposed to just winging it.
2. Definitely fell a little short of completing the goals I set for myself. I was very happy with the amount of work I put in and how dedicated I stayed to working on Go code, however I am very disappointed to not have completed my GitLab interview, any Twilio code, etc. 
3. This sprint need to really focus in on accomplishing goals and completing some of the tasks listed. So the commitment is to improve follow-through on goals and things.
