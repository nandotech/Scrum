# Sprint Retrospective 5/7/2018

#### Monday // Prior to planning next sprint

1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?


1. Not much, after the first 3-4 days I totally fell off and stopped progressing.
2. Everything--I need to commit and work on my code on a daily basis.
3. I am committing to improve progress during these next 2 weeks--I must complete a project.
