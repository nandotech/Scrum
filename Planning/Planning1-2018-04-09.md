### **Summary**
-------------

Since this is our very first session, much of the backlog will be comprised of learning materials.

Still in the process of learning Go, so until they are completed the first items that will be completed are the complete listing of Gophercises and Just For Func series. 

During this time I will begin working on our first full Go app, which will be a CLI app that interacts with the Twilio API and a local Postgresql database. 

_This project will begin as a simple utility for purchasing phone numbers from Twilio and will expand from there_

- [ ] Allow for checking/parsing CDRs
- [ ] Check existing numbers/status, choose to remove inactive etc
- [ ] Interact with both MySQL & Postgresql databases (vici & local)
- [ ] If multiple DB's cause issues, can make tables in MySQL

Due to this, I will add more backlog items re: this app as this sprint goes along.

Current 13 point item + 2 point card is for setup and getting app to take arguments + interact with Twilio and databases.  Further development will be on additional cards.
