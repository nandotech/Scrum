1. Didn't accomplish too much yesterday. I opened my GitLab account and set up a repository over there. Updated this Scrum repo a little bit. Monitored Google Analytics.
    * I did set up a call with a possible client for UMG for 3pm
2. Today I will begin working on the GitLab project, whatever I am able to do.  Problem is mostly laid out, need to start coding.
3. Still only sticking point is a difficulty getting started.  I think "just do it" will be an effective way to get myself started.
