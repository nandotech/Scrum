# Daily Standup 4/18/2018

1. Yesterday I had very good intentions. Unfortunately that resulted mostly in reading blogs, updating apps on my system, etc. Even when tangentially related to programming/Go, such things essentially accomplish nil.
2. Actually decided to have this standup very late (after 3pm) after originally deciding that I should skip today early on. Playing a Just For Func for motivation and hopefully continue work on our jobapp utility.
3. Simple lack of direction or understanding how to move forward in solving our problem can be paralyzing at times. I suppose that is only natural, but is something we absolutely need to work through. Right now I'm not positive what my next step to complete the task actually _is_.
