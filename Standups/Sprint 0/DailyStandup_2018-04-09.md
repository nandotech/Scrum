# Daily Standup 4/9/2018

1) I re-read chapters 7, 8 and 9 on concurrency patterns, the standard library & testing/benchmarking.  Learned that benchmarks are also built into the Go stdlib.

2) Today I will begin and complete gophercises exercise 2
3) No blockers, just started this process extremely late in the day (4pm) so in order to complete #2 will probably have to do some work from home.
