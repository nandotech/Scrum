# Daily Standup 4/11/2018

1. I completed Gophercises Ex 2 as far as the videos go and watched some further educational stuff--checked out golangbook.com
2. I will watch and follow JustForFunc #12 & 13 and decide what my next step is.  Options are between 
* Gitlab Project
* urlshortener w/ all features
* twilio cli app
3. Just unable to decide on what to do next because I'm not really sure how/where to start, really.
