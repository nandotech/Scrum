# Daily Standup 5/14/2018

1. Nothing.  Relaxing weekend.
2. Today I will start and complete 1 or 2 Gophercises and/or JustForFunc.  Depending on my comfort level, beginning Twilio API app would be awesome.
3. I have slightly stalled on following my SCRUM, not to mention actually completing the tasks set forth on my list.  "Current Sprint" has been awfully lonely and no cards have moved in quite some time.
