# Daily Standup 5/7/2018

1. Nothing.  Relaxing weekend.
2. Today I will start and complete 1 or 2 Gophercises and/or JustForFunc.  Depending on my comfort level, beginning Twilio API app would be awesome.
3. My Gitlab interview process has been ended, so I am now my only actual blocker.  I need to keep practicing and get more comfortable with Go, then move on to further applications for difference engineering positions (e.g. Uber)
