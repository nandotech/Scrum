# Daily Standup 4/19/2018

1. Had a bad day and did late standup--ultimately decided on Gophercises Ex 3, but I didn't get very far on my own just playing around with passing JSON data around.
2. Gophercises Ex 3 & Gitlab Ex depending on progress.
3. Just feel like I am lacking direction much of the time. Need to stay dedicated, maybe see if any possibility to find mentorship opportunity (to be mentored, lol).
