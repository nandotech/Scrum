# Daily Standup 4/30/2018

1. Did not accomplish much, have had a few off days.
2. Get back on my Go programming today--start with a JustForFunc and begin work on Twilio CLI app.
3. Lack of progress has me stuck.

NOTE: This is literally same as 4/27.  Have had a rough/bad week in the name of progress and learning.

I vow to do better and be better. Next week, 5/7 should be a retrospective--very disappointing if I have nothing to share.
