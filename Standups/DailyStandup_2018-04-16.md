# Daily Standup 4/16/2018

1. Monday morning, so mostly relaxed. I did begin to lay out/plan my ideas for the GitLab project and questions though.
2. Plan to begin and complete all GitLab interview questions aside from coding exercise (question 1).
3. I find myself having trouble knowing where or how to start on something independently.  While I do understand the concepts and can follow a solution, I'm having trouble knowing exactly where or how to begin solving the problem.
