# Daily Standup 4/13/2018

1. Yesterday I completed Just For Func 12 & 13 -- migrated `sayrpc` into own directory.  Utilizing `makefile`, `kubernetes`, `docker` and `gcp` I set up a primitive CI pipeline publishing an image to `gcr` and running a kube cluster in the cloud.
2. Today I will begin work on Gitlab Interview exercise, app and questions. Since I feel more comfortable that I can answer the questions more quickly than complete the coding exercise, I will commit to completing that.
3. Getting my hands to the keyboard--just need to start putting in work now.
