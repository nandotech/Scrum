# Daily Standup 4/23/2018

1. Weekend was pretty chill...last thing done was completed CYOA app.
2. Need to review CYOA code to get a little better understanding, then work on completing a few tasks if possible. At worst, begin to hack something together perhaps for Twilio & fetching phone numbers.
3. Once again just need to keep learning so that I am more confident in writing some new code on my own.
