Repository housing readme files for Sprint Planning, Review &amp; Daily Standups

This is simply to be utilized as an accountability tool. 

Since currently this is a one-man operation, this is simply in place to force Daily Standups as well as Sprint Planning/Review. Planning will typically be reflected on our Trello board, so we may only create markdown files for the Sprint Review.


### Daily Standup Format

##### 3 Questions

1) What did you do yesterday?
2) What will you do today?
3) Is there anything impeding your progress?


### Sprint Retrospective

##### Questions/Retrospective to be completed after every sprint (2 weeks)

_In regards to the sprint:_
1) What went well?
2) What could be improved?
3) What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?

### Sprint Planning

##### Creating Current Sprint listing from Backlog

1) Assign relative story point value
2) Remove dependencies
3) Create testable examples
4) Define acceptance criteria
5) Meets INVEST criteria

**A good user story should be:**

* "I" ndependent (of all others)
* "N" egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
* "V" aluable (or vertical)
* "E" stimable (to a good approximation)
* "S" mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
* "T" estable (in principle, even if there isn't a test for it yet)
